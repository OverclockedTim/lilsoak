      <description>On Pause First, an update! Lil&amp;rsquo;Soak Designs is currently on pause. As much as we passionately believed in the project (and still do), circumstances and economics mean that we aren&amp;rsquo;t able to keep it going right now. So, for now, we aren&amp;rsquo;t able to share stories and products from brilliant artisans around the world, but we still believe that you can make a difference by thinking carefully about who is making and benefiting from the products you buy, and hope that someday we will return to this project and try again.</description>
